## üöÄ Introduction & Core Mission  
Job seekers often feel unprepared for interviews due to a lack of realistic practice and personalized feedback. Practicing with friends or using static online guides rarely replicates real-world pressure or provides objective critique.  

**MockMate AI addresses this gap** by providing an accessible, affordable, and objective tool that simulates interviews and gives instant, constructive feedback.
